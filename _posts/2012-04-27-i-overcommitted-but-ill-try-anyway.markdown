# I Overcommitted, But I'll Try Anyway

I made a bold decision [yesterday](http://epixa.com/2012/04/on-inspiration-chains-and-being-awesome.html).  In fact, I made three.  I decided to exercise every single day, practice guitar every single day, and publish a blog post every day of the work week.  For those that do not know me personally, let me explain how ridiculous that is.

Believe it or not, working out isn't the most difficult thing for me to do.  We have a room in the house that is sort of a home-gym -- it has a stationary bike and an elliptical machine, so I don't need to worry about the fuss or inconvenience of going to the gym.  Plus, there is no better time to start working out than in the spring.  If I want to get outside, I can always take a run through beautiful downtown Lancaster, and I am encouraged to work out by the thought of losing a little weight by the time my vacation rolls around in August.

Playing guitar regularly is actually a lot harder for me than I expected.  I enjoy playing it, and I would love to be better at it, but I can't seem to really *nail* some key chords (e.g. C) that are required to play pretty much any song.  That said, I could practice guitar for only 15 minutes a day and be meeting my goal, so I think that is going to be doable.

Blogging is the real bastard of the three.  For a long while, I've wanted to blog all the time.  I've never had a shortage of ideas for blog posts (until about 5 minutes ago when I put myself on the spot to figure out what I was going to write about today).  I don't blog frequently, however, because it takes me *forever* to write a single blog post.  I'm anal about anything I publish under my name.  Traditionally, I would focus on every single sentence that I wrote.  I'd ask myself if it were adding value to the article as a whole, and before I knew it four hours would go by and I'd be staring at only a three paragraph introduction.  I'm confident that if I were to calculate the average time it took me to write each of my previous blog articles, the number would be greater than six hours.

I don't have six free hours each day to write blog posts.

So I started pondering over lunch this afternoon, how on earth can I possibly make this work while still writing blog posts that are even marginally interesting or useful?  Honestly, the thought of how I was going to back myself out of the commitment also ran through my head a few times.  I ultimately decided that if I am to succeed in publishing a blog post every day, I need a plan.

To devise said plan, I was inspired by someone that I hadn't really given much thought to in a really long time: Starcraft 2 commentator and comedian, Sean Plott (aka Day[9]).  In 2009, Sean started a webcast called the Day[9] Daily in which he discusses and analyzes all-things Starcraft, and he's continued doing so now, with few exceptions, every single day.  He keeps this organized and interesting by having specific themes for each day of the week (e.g. Funday Monday, Friendsday Wednesday, etc.).

So while I guarantee no fun on any days, I'm going to give a similar organizational style a shot for my blog posts.

## Monday - PHP
Every Monday I'm going to talk about a specific thing in the PHP community.  This may include any commits or feature discussions that I think you may find interesting, upcoming events, CFPs, or open source project news.

## Tuesday - Tutorials
Tutorial Tuesday, as I may come to call it (look ma, I'm creative like Sean Plott), will be exactly what the name describes.  I'll give a short tutorial on something programming or software related.  This will most likely be dominated by JavaScript or PHP tutorials, but who knows what topics I may discuss (I don't, for the record).

## Wednesday - Open Source Showcase
Each Wednesday, I'll identify a specific open source project and talk a bit about what it does, what uses it has, who's behind it, etc.  Most of these projects will be new to me.

## Thursday - Terminal Tricks
If you do any development in linux environments, you're probably well-versed in the art of the command line.  Each Thursday, I'll point out a cool command, trick, or just general practice from which I think some may people may benefit.  I'll try to make the majority of these applicable to most linux environments, but they may occasionally be focussed on specific environments.

## Friday - Off Topic
I will no doubt be bored of writing about technical stuff by Friday, so this one is totally up in the air.  That's not to say that Fridays will never be technical, but do not be surprised to see posts on beer, pictures of failed cooking experiments, or rants about people using cell phones in-line at coffee shops.

So there you have it.  That's my game plan for keeping my blogging focussed, and hopefully it'll be enough to keep me writing a new post as frequently as I had hoped.
