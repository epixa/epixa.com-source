On Inspiration, Chains, and Being Awesome
=========================================

This morning, I've been working on resolving a really frustrating bug. I won't bore you with the details, but it is one of those bugs that happens relatively inconsistently, has no logical explanation, cannot be reproduced manually, and is not triggering or logging any errors.  It just pops up, appears to break the script, and then leaves no trace of its evil-doing.

So eventually, I did what any good programmer would do when they were getting infuriated while staring at their terminal: alt+tab, cmd+t, n, enter.  Then I spent the next 30 seconds cmd+clicking the various articles on Hacker News that I wanted to read.

Usually when I do this, I waste about 20 minutes quickly reading through the tabs I opened, applying whatever upvotes I think are necessary, and then I'm back to being mad at the ones and zeros that ruined my morning.  But today, I didn't get past the first article I opened.

["How I Tricked Myself Into Being Awesome"](http://japhr.blogspot.com/2012/04/366-or-how-i-tricked-myself-into-being.html) by Chris Strom had a profound affect on me.  When I finished reading it, I was inspired.  I'm not sure if I was inspired to do anything in particular, but I was most definitely inspired.  I needed to do something productive right away.

I closed the rest of the tabs in my browser and looked around for something to do.  I grabbed a handful of papers from my needs-to-be-shredded pile and shredded them until my little shredder's overheated light came on.  I looked around for something else to do, but there was nothing in my immediate area, so I decided that I may need to spread out this inspired productivity a bit.

I created a new account at [chains.cc](http://chains.cc) and added three new chains: Work Out, Publish A Blog Article, and Practice Guitar.  The idea of chains, for those that are not familiar, is to define an action that you want to do every day, and then to add another link to the chain for each day that you do it.  If you miss a link on even a single day, then the chain is broken and you must start again.  The ultimate hope is that by gamifying positive daily habits, you make it that much easier to keep up with them.

It may not work for everyone, and it may not work for me, but I'm intrigued and excited by the possibility.  In my experience, adopting positive daily habits improves my overall productivity and happiness.  I don't expect to be awesome like Chris, but I'm going to try anyway.

With that, I complete my first link for one of my new chains.  Now I'm off to go hunt down and destroy that magical bug with renewed vigor.
