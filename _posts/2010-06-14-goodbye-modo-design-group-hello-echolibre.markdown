Goodbye Modo Design Group, Hello echolibre
==========================================

After more than two years, I am both saddened and excited to say that I am leaving [Modo Design Group][modo].

I'm saddened because I loved working at Modo.  It was wonderful being a part of a rapidly growing company from very early on, and I was constantly challenged [in a good way] by the myriad of new and cutting edge technologies that we implemented in some of the most fantastic client projects I have come across to date.  Modo is comprised of some of the most talented and inspiring individuals I have ever had the privilege of working with, and I truly wish them the best of luck in everything they do.

I am excited because I will be joining the team at [echolibre][echolibre] on June 29th.  They are an amazing bunch of guys with seemingly endless talent, and I cannot wait to start contributing to the team.  I am always looking to expand my current skillset and work with the best people in the industry, and I believe I will do just that with the fellas from abroad.
