2011: An Extraordinary Year in Review
=====================================

Wow.  What a year.  I am sure that probably sounds a bit cheesy, but it is an honest sentiment.  A year ago today, I'm sure I felt like 2011 was going to be productive, but I never would have imagined that the year would be defined by such profound personal and professional changes.

For the uninformed, I started working at [Echolibre][echolibre] in June of the previous year, and it was my first telecommuting gig.  It took a few months to get completely accustomed to that type of workflow, so I guess you could say that I didn't really feel at "home" when actually working full-time out of my house until this year.  In February, I think I finally came into my own as a telecommuting developer, and I documented my tips for staying productive in my first [article][article-feb26] of the year.

In the meantime, [David Coallier][david], [Eamon Leonard][eamon], and [Helgi Þormar Þorbjörnsson][helgi] had been planning and working on the then-secret [Orchestra][orchestra] platform.  I was eager to cut my teeth on the project, but we were self-bootstrapping its development through the consultant work, so every minute any of us spent on the project was one less dollar we had to keep the project afloat.  Finally, I logged my first commit to Orchestra in March.

Early in the same month, a theme of blog articles started to spring up throughout the web.  In numerous "Ideas of March" posts, open source developers discussed the merits of knowledge sharing through traditional blogging rather than through social networks and micro-blogging services such as twitter.  This struck a chord with me as many of these authors had inspired me through their own blogs over the years.  I had been trying to think of a way to explain my feelings on the matter for some time, so I jumped on the bandwagon with my own plea to ["Think About the Little Guy"].

When May rolled around, it was time to launch the first of three new client applications on which I worked. [Redeem&Get][redeem-get] is an application that allows businesses to manage coupon campaigns and customers; it is designed to give businesses an easy way to honor online deals and to maximize the benefits associated with the influx of new customers.  At Echolibre, I managed the technical development of the project, from the very first line of code until the beta launch.

June marked another important client milestone at Echolibre as we helped to launch the [RentView][rentview] beta.  RentView is the product of many months of hard work and over a decade of property management experience by its co-founders Colin Napper and Andreas Riha.  The application is the culmination of their grand vision: to make the process of managing rental properties clearer for letting agents, landlords, and tenants while dramatically cutting the usual wastes in time and money associated with managing and renting properties.  I joined the project after it was well underway, but I'm happy to have managed it through its final months of development.

In late July and into August, I started playing around with [Symfony 2][symfony2].  It is a really impressive example of the power you can wield with all of the modern features of PHP 5.3 in a full-blown application framework.  For a few weeks, I was actually completely hooked, and I even thought about making the switch from Zend Framework permanent.  During that time, I wrote one of my initially-least successful blog articles about [choice lists][article-aug16] in Symfony 2 forms.  Despite its lackluster traffic at first, the article has surprisingly grown into one of the biggest traffic generators from search engines over the long term.

Where the choice list article has proven to be a long term traffic boon, my second article in August was by far my biggest initial traffic-draw.  More people visited ["How PHP is Broken and How it Can Be Fixed"][aug31] in the first three days than had visited my entire site in the previous two months.  The responses in the comments, twitter, and google+ were numerous, and the discussion became heated.  Feeling that any positive critiques I may have about the PHP project were being overshadowed by the confrontational nature of the article, I decided to write a follow up to the article that would hopefully be more constructive.

August concluded with a bang when the [news][announcement] broke that [Engine Yard][engineyard] acquired Orchestra.  It is hard to quantify how big of an event this was for us.  We have an amazing team of developers that are entrenched in the open source and PHP communities, but Orchestra was only introduced in 2011 -- years after the Platform as a Service industry was pioneered.  Fortunately for us, Engine Yard was one such pioneer, and their experience and product are in a league of their own.  Together, all of the pieces started falling together, and as a result, Orchestra will truly shine in 2012 and beyond.

At this point, I wanted to start hacking away at the Orchestra platform, but we still had responsibilities at Echolibre.  I worked on our final project at Echolibre throughout September and into October: [WorldIrish][worldirish], has the ambitious goal of compiling the definitive online catalog of the "Irish Experience" throughout the world.  Despite still being in beta, it has networked together more than 11,000 people who wish to share their own Irish stories, ideas, and experiences.

Three days after completing my work on WorldIrish, I was officially hired by Engine Yard to work full-time on the Orchestra platform.  I guess you could call this a "dream come true" moment for me.  Since then, I've been spending most of my time within the web application and APIs that power the platform.  I wish I could talk about everything we're planning and/or working on because it is so damn cool.

As if October was not awesome enough, Elyse and I brought our month of October to an end with the purchase of our first house.  It was relatively unexpected, but it is beautiful, and it is home, and we love it.

Compared to October, November was largely uneventful.  I used this time to finally get back to something I promised weeks before; I wrote my [followup][article-nov14] to my "How PHP is Broken and How it Can Be Fixed" article.  The followup generated less traffic than its predecessor, but I think I did a much better job offering criticisms of the PHP project while attempting to explain some of the steps that are being taken for improvement as well as offering some practical suggestions to improve the process further.  It is what I wanted my original article to be, so I'm more than happy with it.

As the year came to a close, I flew out to hang out with the team and see the new Orchestra offices on Barrow Street in Dublin, Ireland.  For the record, the offices are gorgeous.  While I do love working from home, the offices are cool enough that I am *almost* jealous of the crew that works out of Dublin.  They are still doing a lot of work on the space over there, but I'm confident there will be a bunch of pictures posted of the joint when it is all finished.

In my final days in Ireland, when I sat in David Coallier's kitchen in front of the fireplace drinking hot port until god-knows-when, I was awestruck when I thought back to all of the things that happened in my life this year.  2011 was an extraordinary year for me, and I cannot wait to see what awesome things await in 2012.
