title: About Court Ewing
---

<p>I am Court Ewing, and I am an Engineer on the <a href="http://orchestra.io">Orchestra</a> platform at <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>, where I work my butt off with some of the best developers and open source aficionados around.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to programming when I stumbled upon PHP in 1997, and I was hooked ever since.  I had no opportunities for learning programming in school, and I didn't know anyone who was involved in the industry, so I sought out as much information on the subject as I could on the web.  My first contract project was in 1999, and I am delighted to say that it is still online today (<a href="http://haasvalue.com">in all of its frameset/mspaint goodness</a>).</p>

<p>I've built my entire career upon open source technologies, so I am both indebted and gracious for all that it has given me.  This blog is my way to give back to the community.</p>

<p>I am powered by coffee.</p>
